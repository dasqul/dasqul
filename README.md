# 👋 Hi, welcome to my profile

I'm a developer from the **Czech Republic 🇨🇿**, currently a **minor (not 18+)**, with a strong passion for **programming**, technology, and self-improvement.

## 🧠 About Me
I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood. Programming is more than just writing code for me — it’s about solving problems, building ideas from scratch, and constantly learning something new.

I like experimenting with different approaches, improving my logic, and pushing myself to get better every day. Even small projects matter to me because they help me grow as a developer.

## 💻 What I Do
- Write code and build projects  
- Learn new concepts and technologies  
- Improve my problem-solving skills  
- Explore how software and systems work  

## 🎮 Beyond Coding
When I’m not coding, I usually spend time gaming, relaxing, or talking with people online. I enjoy meeting new people, exchanging ideas, and having meaningful or chill conversations.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m still on my journey as a developer and always open to learning:
- New programming languages  
- Better coding practices  
- Tools and workflows that make development cleaner and smarter  

## 🤝 Let’s Connect
I’m open to discussions, collaborations, and learning together.  
If you want to talk, share ideas, or just say hi — **DMs are open.**
